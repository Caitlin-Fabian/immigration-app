          <strong>If yes, you may already be a U.S. citizen.</strong> In most situations, any child that is born in the United States or one of its territories will automatically receive American citizenship. This is called "birthright citizenship"
          and is protected by the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which (in Section 1) states the following:

          <br><em>All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.</em><br>

          However, children born to diplomats and other recognized government officials from foreign countries won't receive U.S. citizenship if born on American soil (Title 8 of the U.S. Code). If you were born in the United States, your U.S.
          citizenship will last your entire life unless you make an affirmative action to give it up, like filing an oath.

          <strong>If yes, you may already be a U.S. citizen.</strong> In many cases you are a U.S. citizen if your parent became a U.S. citizen (or was already a citizen) before your 18th birthday. But immigration laws have changed over the years.
          Children under 18 years of age automatically acquire U.S. citizenship if the following three conditions have been fulfilled:

          At least one of the childâ€™s parents is a U.S. citizen by birth or naturalization;
          The child is a permanent resident under 18 years of age;
          The child is residing in or has resided in the United States in the legal and physical custody of the U.S. citizen parent.

          The three requirements can occur in any order.

          <strong>What to do.</strong>
          Refer to Form N-600, Application for Certificate
          of Citizenship, or Form N-600K, Application for
          Citizenship and Issuance of Certificate, for more
          information. If you have a U.S. citizen parent who
          is a U.S. citizen by either birth or naturalization you
          may already be a citizen or may be able to apply for a
          Certificate of Citizenship based on their citizenship.
          If you do not believe you are a U.S. citizen by birth or
          did not acquire or derive U.S. citizenship from your
          parent or parents automatically after birth, go to the
          next step. <img class="accordionArrow" src="Images/Arrow.png" alt="">
